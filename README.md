# next-GPT

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses [GPT](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to generate text, which is designed with new UI/UX in mind.

## Introduction

This project is a learning experience for me to learn Nextjs Pages Router rather than Nextjs App Router.
I am also using this project to learn how to build a project with Nextjs and Tailwindcss.
Additionally, Typescript has been incorporated into the entire project.

## Features

- [x] Website UI/UX accomplished with Tailwindcss
  - [x] Website components (Menu, Chat, etc.) 
  - [x] Dark mode and Light mode
  - [x] Mobile support
  - [x] i18n Internationalization
  - [x] Home page animation

- [x] GPT-3 API integration

- [ ] Database integration
  - [ ] PostgreSQL

- [ ] Login authentication

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
